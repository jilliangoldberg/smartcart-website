            The Walmart "Smart Cart" is an app that solves the problem of forgotten grocery items. 
            On the home screen, users can see their own personal shopping cart, where they can add
            their own items to the list. But wait - scroll down and that's where the magic happens!

        <h3>
          Users get suggestions for new items they might want to buy based on their past purchases,
          making it seem almost like the Smart Cart can read their mind. It uses past purchasing
          data to find correlations between items and the frequency they are bought!

          <h3 class="product__title">The Use of Algorithms</h3>
          <p class="product__description">
            The Smart Cart would use both the user's personal past purchases
            and a larger database of product correlations to predict what someone may want to
            buy in the future.

            It would also track purchase history to see how frequently a user is buying a product,
            so it can suggest the same product to them - when the time comes!

        <h2>
          ==== Consumers ====
        </h2>
        <h4>
          Consumers get suggestions on what to buy and get notified when it's 
          time to buy some of their favorite items. They get to build a virtual cart
          in their pocket, where they can add new orders, receipts, and take pictures
          of their cart to track what they buy. Shoppers will never have to take extra,
          inconvenient trips to the grocery store again!
        </h4>
        <h2>
          ==== Walmart ====
        </h2>
        <h4>
          Just as consumers benefit from the Smart Cart, Walmart is able to build
          a more loyal customer base and encourage shoppers to continue buying their 
          favorite products right off the Walmart shelves! This would increase the 
          retention rate of customers, while also building a personalized experience 
          for each of their customers.
        </h4>
        <h2>
          ==== The Environment ====
        </h2>
        <h4>
          One of the most pressing issues of our time is climate change, and 
          a large part of saving the globe is decreasing pollution caused
          by cars. With the Smart Cart, people will no longer have to take those
          extra trips to the grocery store, which decreases vehicle emissions 
          and lowers the overall transport waste each and every year.

              Hi there! My name is Jillian and I'm a sophomore at UC Berkeley, 
              majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science + Business Administration.
              I'm a part of the Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology (MET) program, which
              is a collaborative cohort of 50 students.

            <p class="about_me">
              I'm passionate about data science and machine learning, and more broadly
              applying technology to solve consumer-centric problems in creative ways. 
              I hope to use these tools to impact the world in a positive way, just as 
              Walmart does each and every day.
